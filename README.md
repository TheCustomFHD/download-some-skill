# download-some-skill
When a friend, a coworker, or anyone else is struggling to do something simple, ask them to "download-some-skill" from Github!

# What can this do?
- burn some of the recievers ego
- make laughs and be funny
- destroy friendships
- get you fired (Not yet proofed, would appreciate an Issue regarding proof)

# How good is the Skill Implementation?
You're only downloading some skill, so it wont do wonders. However, it might open a new train of thought, so it can help.

# Installation Guide
It is super simple, but will leave you with slight less Storage. Delete the Folder it creates as soon as you dont need it anymore, reinstall the next time you need some skill.
```
git clone https://github.com/TheCustomFHD/download-some-skill.git
```

# Warranty?
None. I do not offer any debugging, help of setup or mental issues due to loosing your friends.
I also do not take any responsibilities about you using this tool, or anything that happens as a chain reaction due to this. Use at your own risk!
